This is a proposed GUI for the CIME/CESM2 Case Control System.  It uses a python 2.7 interface to PyQt5
You will need to set the PYTHONPATH to point to both the CIME tree and this one
eg PYTHONPATH=$CIMEROOT/scripts:$CIMEROOT/scripts/lib/:$CCCGROOT/cccg
Once you have PyQt5 installed you can run:

 python ./setup.py build_ui
 python -m cccg

To build and run the GUI on your system.
